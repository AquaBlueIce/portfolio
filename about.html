      <h2>My Story</h2>
      <p class="about-me-text">
        Hello, I'm Akuwa, and I embarked on my coding journey from a simple
        moment of inspiration. It all began when I saw my sister, a diligent
        BSIT (Bachelor of Science in Information Technology) student,
        passionately immersed in the world of technology. Witnessing her
        dedication and the remarkable things she could create through coding
        ignited a spark within me. From that moment, I knew I had found my
        calling in the realm of technology and software development.
        <br />
        <br />
        In addition to my passion for coding, I have a strong academic
        foundation. I pursued a degree in Computer Engineering and proudly
        graduated on June 28, 2023. My educational journey has equipped me with
        a solid understanding of both hardware and software, making me a
        well-rounded technologist.
        <br /><br />
        But the learning journey doesn't stop with graduation. I'm currently
        enrolled in numerous Udemy courses to keep expanding my knowledge and
        skills in various programming languages and emerging technologies. My
        commitment to self-improvement and staying up-to-date with industry
        trends is a fundamental aspect of my journey.
        <br /><br />
        My coding journey has been a thrilling adventure, driven by my desire to
        create, innovate, and push the boundaries of what's possible in the
        digital landscape. I've also had the privilege of creating multiple
        projects in different programming languages, which has not only honed my
        skills but also allowed me to tackle a wide range of challenges. Join me
        as I share my coding odyssey, experiences, and the diverse projects that
        have defined my path in the world of IT.
